This is the development tree of delirium.

The documentation may be non-existant, or out of date. I'm in the process
of translating notes from paper, and in my head, into actual readable
text files. 

Until then, the source is going to be the best place to start.
kernel/kernel.c makes a good C entry point, or arch/i386/boot.S if you're
a bit more interested in evil.

The userspace interface documentation got lost when the svn repository
went down, so the code in apps would be unfortunately the best place to
look. The apps/* files, with the exception of dlib and eve, were only
put together as tests. apps/test/test.c is the original test suite,
and should test some of the basics (threading, IPC etc).

The target so far has been gcc-3.4. gcc-4.0.4 has been reputed to work,
however might cause problems until gcc-4 is a bit more tested. Assembly
that might work in linux userspace is going to burn you when you're
trying to compile the memory protection itself.

Good luck.
