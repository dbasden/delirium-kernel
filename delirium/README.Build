./build-i386 will rebuild the tree and place the binary in ./floppy.386
This probably won't work straight off on a new system for reasons that
will be obvious if you read build-i386

./build-fake builds a userspace binary of the system. It probably broke
some time ago when I started caring more about much more arch dependant
stuff like task switching

./qemu-delirium just runs floppy.386 in a qemu process.  There are
also scripts for bochs
