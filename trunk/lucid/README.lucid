lucid is a compile-time wrapper to allow DeLiRiuM apps to run in
unix userspace. It works enough to hook the TCP stack up

Things working:
	- IPC (rants, soapboxes etc)
	- Memory allocation (both getpage and kpools)
	- serial port emulation/hooks through to a pty

Things not working
	- kherdpages
	- threads (currently just running the entry point and processing
	  rants in a global event loop)
	- ktimer  (although mostly done)
